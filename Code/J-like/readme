7. Conditional statements : If-else

10. Class, Constructors - Initializing objects, calling member functions, variables, 
12. Advanced Class - function overloading, inheritance

TODO:
1. Can't use array of objects of same class as member variables because A is not yet fully defined when the array is created
Hence 'a' won't be accessible from a[1]
eg. class A {
		A a[5];
    }

2. Use 'constructor'and 'function' keyowrd before declaring constructor and function respectively.
3. For calling a function of the same class from different function, refer it using 'this'.
