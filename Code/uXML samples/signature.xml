        Desc : Signature definition (one or more)
                - Defines the signature of a function. This signature can be later used 
                  while defining a function of this signature type.  
        Attr : name
                - Name of the signature. This name will be used in the function definition. For more information
                  check function.xml
    -->
        <function-type name="sig1">

            <!-- 
            Desc : Member variables (zero or more)
                    - Specifies the data-type of formal parameters. If this element is not present, it means
                      signature doesn't take any argument.
                      
                      Formal parameters contains name attribute so that user can re-order the parameters while calling the function.
                      User need to simply map the variables with the name before calling. (Allowed in some Programming Languages)
                      
                      For this example, there are set of arguments declared eg. int, function having signature 'sigName',.., array of int, pointer to int and
                      a map. For each of the type definition, see variableDeclaration1.xml
                      
                      Data-type could be anything defined in variableDeclaration.xml
                      
                      Data-type should adhere to the rules of programming language whose source code the uXML is representating.
                      eg. Java can't pass a parameter of type function, but C,C++, LISP, Python can do that.
        -->

            <var name="a" type="int"/>
            <var name="b" type="sigName"/>
            <!-- List of other variable names -->
            <var name="c" type="arrayA1"/>
            <var name="d" type="ptrP1"/>
            <var name="e" type="mapM1"/>

            <!--
            Desc : Specifies the return-type.
                    As mentioned in variableDeclaration1.xml, the value could be any string representing the language-defined or user-defined 
                    datatype. Data-type should adhere to the rules of programming language whose source code the uXML is representating.
                    eg. Java can't pass a parameter of type function, but C,C++, LISP, Python can do that.
                    
                    Also, if function doesn't return anything, then it needs to be specified explicitely by <var type="void"/>
                    If nothing is specified then the function returns a data-type of "#any#". This is useful for languages like LISP, JavaScript
                    
            For demonstration purpose, I am returning a pointer to a pointer to a variable containing 'integer' number. 
            Check the definition of 'ptrP2' in variableDeclaration1.xml
        -->
            <returns type="ptrP2"/>
        </function-type>
